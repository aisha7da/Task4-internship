# 📊 Kaggle Data Science Survey (2017–2021) - Data Cleaning & Insights

This repository contains my internship project on **data cleaning and insight generation** using the [Kaggle Data Science Survey 2017–2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/kaggle-data-science-survey-20172021).  

The main focus of this task was to clean a real-world survey dataset with inconsistencies and missing values, and then extract meaningful insights about respondent behavior and preferences.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Kaggle Data Science Survey dataset contains responses from thousands of participants across multiple years, covering:
- Demographics  
- Education  
- Tools & technologies used  
- Work experience and roles  

The project workflow involved **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis** to better understand the survey results.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data wrangling & cleaning)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** (visualizations)
- **Seaborn** (statistical plots)
- **Label Encoding / Mapping** (categorical variable handling)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handled **missing values** with imputation or removal when necessary.  
- Removed **duplicate entries** for consistency.  
- Standardized inconsistent formatting in categorical variables.  
- Applied **label encoding/mapping** to categorical features for analysis.

## 📊 Insights & Analysis
- Summary statistics of respondent demographics.  
- Distribution of roles, education levels, and tools used.  
- Group-based insights (e.g., preferences across job roles or regions).  
- Visualizations (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to highlight key patterns.
